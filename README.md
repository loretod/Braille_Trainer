This project is used to fabricate large peg cells used to introduce braille. Each cell represents a letter and is placed within the holder rack.

This project is a remix from: [Braille Peg Cell by 3D Printy | Download free STL model | Printables.com](https://www.printables.com/model/146102-braille-peg-cell). Modifications designed by Noam Platt of [Make Good NOLA](https://makegood.design).

## Materials per cell
|Qty|Item|
|---|---|
|1|[Cell Case](stl/BRAILLE%20CELL%201%20with%20pocket%20v3.stl)|
|1|[Full Base](stl/0711%20base.stl) (6 cells), [Half Base](stl/0711%20half%20base.stl) (3 cells) or [5 cells](stl/NEW%20BASE%205%20CELLS%20WITH%20CONNECTOR.stl) (clip together)|
|12|[Button Caps](stl/Button%20Cap%20(1).stl)|

## Equipment
3D Printer

## Step #1: Print Settings
|Part Name|Material|Sizing|Infill|Support|Layer Height|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Cell Case|PLA or ABS|100%|10%|No|.2 mm|
|Base|PLA or ABS|100%|10%|No|.2 mm|
|Button Cap|PLA or ABS|98%|10%|Skirt or Raft|.15 mm|
|Spring|TPU|100%|100% (solid)|no|.2 mm|

**Note:** also works well scaling everything down to 80% to make a smaller cell 

## Step #2: Assemble
![Fingers pushing 3D printed spring into small cap](images/spring.jpg)
1. Insert the spring into one cap.

![Hand inserting the spring and cap through the hole on the cell](images/push_spring.jpg)
2. Push the spring and cap through the case.

![One hand holding the cap and spring in place while a second hand places another cap on the opposite side of the cell](images/second_cap.jpg)
3. Insert another cap on the opposite side of the cell.

4. Repeat for the remaining 5 holes.
